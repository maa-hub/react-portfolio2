        I am currently a Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelors and Masters degree from Rutgers University. 
        I am attending the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp, learning new skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
        I am very excited to learn these intersetomng programs to broaden my horizon to become a front end developer 
        after the bootcamp ends. 
        I also plan on merging my engineering knowledge and my coding skills to make the world a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
        Coding Rocks!
